=head1 NAME

C<TeXLive::TLPSRC> -- TeX Live Package Source (C<.tlpsrc>) module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use TeXLive::TLPSRC;

  my $tlpsrc = TeXLive::TLPSRC->new(name => "foobar");
  $tlpsrc->from_file("/some/tlpsrc/package.tlpsrc");
  $tlpsrc->from_file("package");
  $tlpsrc->writeout;
  $tlpsrc->writeout(\*FILEHANDLE);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<TeXLive::TLPSRC> module handles TeX Live Package Source
(C<.tlpsrc>) files, which contain all (and only) the information which
cannot be automatically derived from other sources, notably the TeX Live
directory tree and the TeX Catalogue.  In other words, C<.tlpsrc> files
are hand-maintained.

Often they are empty, when all information can be derived from the
package name, which is (by default) the base name of the C<.tlpsrc> file.

=head1 FILE SPECIFICATION

A C<tlpsrc> file consists of lines of the form:

I<key> I<value>

where I<key> can be one of: C<name> C<category> C<catalogue>
C<shortdesc> C<longdesc> C<depend> C<execute> C<postaction> C<tlpsetvar>
C<runpattern> C<srcpattern> C<docpattern> C<binpattern>.

Continuation lines are supported via a trailing backslash.  That is, if
the C<.tlpsrc> file contains two physical lines like this:
  
  foo\
  bar

they are concatenated into C<foobar>.  The backslash and the newline are
removed; no other whitespace is added or removed.

Comment lines begin with a # and continue to the end of the line.
Within a line, a # that is preceded by whitespace is also a comment.

Blank lines are ignored.

The I<key>s are described in the following sections.

=head2 C<name>

identifies the package; C<value> must consist only of C<[-_a-zA-Z0-9]>,
i.e., with what Perl considers a C<\w>. It is optional; if not
specified, the name of the C<.tlpsrc> file will be used (with the
C<.tlpsrc> removed).

There are three exceptions to this rule:

=over 4

=item B<name.ARCH>

where B<ARCH> is a supported architecture-os combination.  This has two
uses.  First, packages are split (automatically) into containers for the
different architectures to make possible installations including only
the necessary binaries.  Second, one can add 'one-arch-only' packages,
often used to deal with Windows peculiarities.

=item B<texlive>I<some.thing>

(notice the dot in the package name) These packages are core TeX Live
packages. They are treated as usual packages in almost all respects, but
have that extra dot to be sure they will never clash with any package
that can possibly appear on CTAN. The only such package currently is
C<texlive.infra>, which contains L<tlmgr> and other basic infrastructure
functionality.

=item B<00texlive>I<something>

These packages are used for internal operation and storage containers
for settings.  I<00texlive> packages are never be split into separate
arch-packages, and containers are never generated for these packages.

The full list of currently used packages of this type is:

=over 8

=item B<00texlive.config>

This package contains configuration options for the TeX Live archive.
If container_split_{doc,src}_files occurs in the depend lines the
{doc,src} files are split into separate containers (.tar.xz) 
during container build time. Note that this has NO effect on the
appearance within the texlive.tlpdb. It is only on container level.
The container_format/XXXXX specifies the format, currently allowed
is only "xz", which generates .tar.xz files. zip can be supported.
release/NNNN specifies the release number as used in the installer.

=item B<00texlive.installation>

This package serves a double purpose:

1. at installation time the present values are taken as default for
the installer

2. on an installed system it serves as configuration file. Since
we have to remember these settings for additional package
installation, removal, etc.

=item B<00texlive.image>

This package collects some files which are not caught by any of the
other TL packages. Its primary purpose is to make the file coverage
check happy.  The files here are not copied by the installer
and containers are not built; they exist only in the
TeX Live Master tree.

=item B<00texlive.installer>

This package defines the files to go into the installer
archives (install-tl-unx.tar.gz, install-tl.zip) built
by the tl-make-installer script.  Most of what's here is also
included in the texlive.infra package -- ordinarily duplicates
are not allowed, but in this case, 00texlive.installer is never
used *except* to build the installer archives, so it's ok.

=back

=back

=head2 C<category>

identifies the category into which this package belongs. This determines
the default patterns applied. Possible categories are defined in
C<TeXLive::TLConfig>, currently C<Collection>, C<Scheme>, C<TLCore>,
C<Package>, C<ConTeXt>. Most packages fall into the C<Package> category,
and this is the default if not specified.

=head2 C<catalogue>

identifies the name under which this package can be found in the TeX
Catalogue. If not specified, the package name is used.

=head2 C<shortdesc>

gives a one line description of the package. Later lines overwrite
earlier, so there's no use in giving it more than once. If not
specified, the default is taken from the TeX Catalogue, which suffices
for almost all normal packages. Thus, in TeX Live, primarily used for
collections and schemes.

=head2 C<longdesc>

gives a long description of the package. Later lines are appended to
earlier ones. As with C<shortdesc>, if not specified, the default is
taken from the TeX Catalogue, which suffices for almost all normal
packages.

=head2 C<depend>

specifies the list of dependencies, which are just other package names.
All the C<depend> lines contribute to the dependencies of the package.
For example, C<latex.tlpsrc> contains (among others):
  
  depend latexconfig
  depend latex-fonts
  depend pdftex

to ensure these packages are installed if the C<latex> package is.  The
directive C<hard> is an alias for C<depend>, since that's we specified
for the C<DEPENDS.txt> files package authors can provide; see
L<https://www.tug.org/texlive/pkgcontrib.html#deps>.

=head2 C<execute>

specifies an install-time action to be executed. The following actions
are supported:

=over 4

=item C<execute addMap> I<font>C<.map>

enables the font map file I<font>C<.map> in the C<updmap.cfg> file.

=item C<execute addMixedMap> I<font>C<.map>

enables the font map file I<font>C<.map> for Mixed mode in the
C<updmap.cfg> file.

=item C<execute AddHyphen name=I<texlang> file=I<file> [I<var>...]>

activates the hyphenation pattern with name I<texlang> and load the file
I<file> for that language.  The additional variables I<var> are:
C<lefthyphenmin>, C<righthyphenmin> (both integers), C<synonyms> (a
comma-separated list of alias names for that hyphenation), C<databases>
(a comma-separated list of databases the entry should go in; currently
recognized are: C<dat> (C<language.dat>), C<def> (C<language.def>) and
C<lua> (C<language.dat.lua>)), C<file_patterns> and C<file_exceptions>
(files with the patterns (resp. exceptions) in plain txt), and
C<luaspecial> (string).

The variable C<databases> defaults to C<dat,def>, or C<dat,def,lua> if
one of the keys C<file_patterns>, C<file_exceptions> or C<luaspecial> is
used.

=item C<execute AddFormat name=I<fmt> engine=I<eng> [I<var>...]>

activates the format with name I<fmt> based on the engine I<eng>. The 
additional variables I<var> are:
C<mode> which can only be equal to C<disable> in which case the format
will only be mentioned but disabled (prefixed with C<#!>;
C<patterns> which gives the patterns file, if not present C<-> is used;
C<options> which gives the additional options for the C<fmtutil.cnf> file.

=back

=head2 C<postaction>

specifies a post-install or post-removal action to be
executed. The difference to the C<execute> statement is that 
C<postaction> is concerned with system integration, i.e., adjusting
things outside the installation directory, while C<execute> touches
only things within the installation.

The following actions are supported:

=over 4

=item C<postaction shortcut name=I<name> type=menu|desktop icon=I<path> cmd=I<cmd> args=I<args> hide=0|1>

On W32 creates a shortcut either in the main TeX Live menu or on the
desktop. See the documentation of L<TeXLive::TLWinGoo> for details.

=item C<postaction filetype name=I<name> cmd=I<cmd>>

On W32 associates the file type I<name> with the command I<cmd>.

=item C<postaction fileassoc extension=I<.ext> filetype=I<name>>

On W32 declares files with the extenstion I<.ext> of file type I<name>.

=item C<postaction script file=I<file> [filew32=I<filew32>]>

This postaction executes the given I<file> with two arguments, the first
being either the string C<install> or C<remove>, the second being the
root of the installation.

If the C<filew32> argument is given this script is run on Windows systems
instead of the one given via C<file>.

=back

=head2 C<tlpsetvar> I<var> I<val>

sets variable I<var> to I<val>. Order matters: the variable can be
expanded with C<${>I<var>C<}>, only after it is defined. Characters
allowed in the I<var> name are C<-_a-zA-Z0-9>.

For example, the Xindy program is not supported on all platforms, so we
define a variable:

  tlpsetvar no_xindy_platforms i386-solaris,x86_64-linuxmusl,x86_64-solaris

that can then by used in each C<binpattern> needed:

  binpattern f/!${no_xindy_platforms} bin/${ARCH}/texindy
  binpattern f/!${no_xindy_platforms} bin/${ARCH}/tex2xindy
  ...

(The C<binpattern> details are below; here, just notice the variable
definition and expansion.)

Ordinarily, variables can be used only within the C<.tlpsrc> file where
they are defined. There is one exception: global tlpsrc variables can be
defined in the C<00texlive.autopatterns.tlpsrc> file (mentioned below);
their names must start with C<global_>,
and can only be used in C<depend>, C<execute>, and C<...pattern>
directives, another C<tlpsetvar>. For example, our
C<autopatterns.tlpsrc> defines:

  tlpsetvar global_latex_deps babel,cm,hyphen-base,latex-fonts

And then any other C<.tlpsrc> files can use it as
C<${global_latex_deps}>; in this case, C<latex-bin.tlpsrc>,
C<latex-bin-dev.tlpsrc>, C<platex.tlpsrc>, and others (in C<execute
AddFormat> directives).

=head2 C<(src|run|doc|bin)pattern> I<pattern>

adds I<pattern> (next section) to the respective list of patterns.

=head1 PATTERNS

Patterns specify which files are to be included into a C<tlpobj> at
expansion time. Patterns are of the form

  [PREFIX]TYPE[/[!]ARCHSPEC] PAT

where

  PREFIX = + | +! | !
  TYPE = t | f | d | r
  ARCHSPEC = <list of architectures separated by comma>

Simple patterns without PREFIX and ARCHSPEC specifications are explained
first.

=over 4

=item C<f> I<path>

includes all files which match C<path> where B<only> the last component
of C<path> can contain the usual glob characters C<*> and C<?> (but no
others!). The special string C<ignore> for I<path> means to ignore this
pattern (used to eliminate the auto-pattern matching).

=item C<d> I<path>

includes all the files in and below the directory specified as C<path>.

=item C<r> I<regexp>

includes all files matching the regexp C</^regexp$/>.

=item C<a> I<name1> [<name2> ...]

includes auto-generated patterns for each I<nameN> as if the package
itself would be named I<nameN>. That is useful if a package (such as
C<venturisadf>) contains top-level directories named after different
fonts.

=item C<t> I<word1 ... wordN wordL>

includes all the files in and below all directories of the form

  word1/word2/.../wordN/.../any/dirs/.../wordL/

i.e., all the first words but the last form the prefix of the path, then
there can be an arbitrary number of subdirectories, followed by C<wordL>
as the final directory. This is primarily used in
C<00texlive.autopatterns.tlpsrc> in a custom way, but here is the one
real life example from a standard package, C<omega.tlpsrc>:

  runpattern t texmf-dist fonts omega

matches C<texmf-dist/fonts/**/omega>, where C<**> matches any number of
intervening subdirectories, e.g.:

  texmf-dist/fonts/ofm/public/omega
  texmf-dist/fonts/tfm/public/omega
  texmf-dist/fonts/type1/public/omega

=back

=head2 Special patterns

=head3 Prefix characters: C<+> and C<!>

If the C<PREFIX> contains the symbol C<!> the meaning of the pattern is
reversed, i.e., files matching this pattern are removed from the list of
included files.

The prefix C<+> means to append to the list of automatically synthesized
patterns, instead of replacing them.

The C<+> and C<!> prefixes can be combined.  This is useful to exclude
directories from the automatic pattern list.  For example,
C<graphics.tlpsrc> contains this line:

  docpattern +!d texmf-dist/doc/latex/tufte-latex/graphics

so that the subdirectory of the C<tufte-latex> package that happens to
be named "graphics" is not mistakenly included in the C<graphics>
package.

=head2 Auto-generated patterns (C<00texlive.autopatterns>)

If a given pattern section is empty or I<all> the provided patterns have
the prefix C<+> (e.g., C<+f ...>), then patterns such as the following,
listed by type, are I<automatically> added at expansion time. The list
here contains examples, rather than being definitive; the added patterns
are actually taken from C<00texlive.autopatterns.tlpsrc>. (That file
also defines any global tlpsrc variables, as described above under
L</tlpsetvar>).

=over 4

=item C<runpattern>

For category C<Package>:

  t texmf-dist I<topdir> %NAME%

where C<%NAME%> means the current package name, and I<topdir> is one of:
C<bibtex> C<context> C<dvips> C<fonts> C<makeindex> C<metafont>
C<metapost> C<mft> C<omega> C<scripts> C<tex>.

For category C<ConTeXt>:

  d texmf-dist/tex/context/third/%context-:NAME%
  d texmf-dist/metapost/context/third/%context-:NAME%
  f texmf-dist/tex/context/interface/third/*%context-:NAME%.xml

(where C<%context-:NAME%> is replaced by the package name with an initial
C<context-> is removed. E.g., if the package is called C<context-foobar>
the replacement in the above rules will be C<foobar>.)

For other categories I<no> patterns are automatically added to the 
list of C<runpattern>s.

=item C<docpattern>

for category C<TLCore>:

  t texmf-dist doc %NAME%
  f texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/%NAME%.*

for category C<Package>:

  t texmf-dist doc %NAME%
  f texmf-dist/doc/man/man1/%NAME%.*

for category C<ConTeXt>:

  d texmf-dist/doc/context/third/%context-:NAME%

=item C<srcpattern>

for category C<Package>:

  t texmf-dist source %NAME%

for category C<ConTeXt>:

  d texmf-dist/source/context/third/%context-:NAME%

(see above for the C<$NAME%> construct)

=item C<binpattern>

No C<binpattern>s are ever automatically added.

=back

=head3 Special treatment of binpatterns

The binpatterns have to deal with all the different architectures. To
ease the writing of patterns, we have the following features:

=over 4

=item Architecture expansion

Within a binpattern, the string C<${ARCH}> is automatically expanded to
all available architectures.

=item C<bat/exe/dll/texlua> for Windows

C<binpattern>s that match Windows, e.g., C<f bin/windows/foobar> or C<f
bin/${ARCH}/foobar>, also match the files C<foobar.bat>, C<foobar.cmd>,
C<foobar.dll>, C<foobar.exe>, and C<foobar.texlua>.

In addition, C<foobar.exe.manifest> and C<foobar.dll.manifest> are matched.

The above two properties allows to capture the binaries for all
architectures in one binpattern

  binpattern f bin/${ARCH}/dvips

and would get C<bin/windows/dvips.exe> into the runfiles for C<arch=windows>.

This C<bat>/C<exe>/etc. expansion I<only> works for patterns of the C<f>
type.

=item ARCHSPEC specification of a pattern

Sometimes files should be included into the list of binfiles of a
package only for some architectures, or for all but some architectures.
This can be done by specifying the list of architectures for which this
pattern should be matched after the pattern specifier using a C</>:

  binpattern f/windows tlpkg/bin/perl.exe

will include the file C<tlpkg/bin/perl.exe> only in the binfiles for
the architecture C<windows>. Another example:

  binpattern f/arch1,arch2,arch3 path/$ARCH/foo/bar

This will only try to match this pattern for arch1, arch2, and arch3.

Normally, a binpattern is matched against all possible architectures. If
you want to exclude some architectures, instead of listing all the ones
you want to include as above, you can prefix the list of architectures
with a ! and these architectures will not be tested. Example:

  binpattern f/!arch1,arch2 path/$ARCH/foo/bar

will be matched against all architectures I<except> arch1 and arch2.

=back

=head1 MEMBER ACCESS FUNCTIONS

For any of the above I<key>s a function

  $tlpsrc->key

is available, which returns the current value when called without an argument,
and sets the respective value when called with an argument.

Arguments and return values for C<name>, C<category>, C<shortdesc>,
C<longdesc>, C<catalogue> are single scalars. Arguments and return values
for C<depends>, C<executes>, and the various C<patterns> are lists.

In addition, the C<_srcfile> member refers to the filename for this
C<TLPSRC> object, if set (normally by C<from_file>).

=head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS

The following functions can be called for a C<TLPSRC> object:

=over 4

=item C<new>

The constructor C<new> returns a new C<TLPSRC> object. The arguments
to the C<new> constructor can be in the usual hash representation for
the different keys above:

  $tlpsrc = TLPSRC->new(name => "foobar",
                        shortdesc => "The foobar package");

=item C<from_file("filename")>

Reads a C<tlpsrc> file from disk.  C<filename> can either be a full path
(if it's readable, it's used), or just a package identifier such as
C<plain>.  In the latter case, the directory searched is the C<tlpsrc>
sibling of the C<TeXLive> package directory where C<TLPSRC.pm> was found.

  $tlpsrc=new TeXLive::TLPSRC;
  $tlpsrc->from_file("/path/to/the/tlpsrc/somepkg.tlpsrc");
  $tlpsrc->from_file("somepkg");

=item C<writeout>

writes the textual representation of a C<TLPSRC> object to stdout, or the
filehandle if given:

  $tlpsrc->writeout;
  $tlpsrc->writeout(\*FILEHANDLE);

=item C<make_tlpobj($tltree)>

creates a C<TLPOBJ> object from a C<TLPSRC> object and a C<TLTREE> object.
This function does the necessary work to expand the manual data and
enrich it with the content from C<$tltree> to a C<TLPOBJ> object.
